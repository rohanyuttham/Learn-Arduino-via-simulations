# Learn-Arduino-via-simulations
This repository acts as a guide for beginners who want to get started with learning arduino.

The tutorial does not requires you to have a physical arduino but you will learn about arduino through online simulations.

The same can then be replicated on a physical arduino too.

Go through the tutorial in the serial order.
In the end, you will have a strong hold on arduino programming
